# HttpServerRust
Standalone Rust Program, serving as a learning purpose. The goal is to implement a HTTP/1.1 Server in Rust to get familiar with the intricacies of the language.

## Additional Files
The `TODO` folder includes additional files of certain sub-goals achieved in the process of creating the server. They showcase the learning steps in a more detailed way.

## Documentation
The code features at times extensive in-line comments to document issues, lessons learned as well as possibilities for extending the code.

## Future
This implementation is lacking in many aspects even if functional. It may be revisited at a future time to expand existing functionality or improve performance / readability.
